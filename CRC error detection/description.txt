implementation of an error-detection mechanism using the standard CRC algorithm.
 1- Generator.py: takes message and generator function, outputs the transmitted message.
 2- Verifier.py: takes Transmitted message and verifies that it is received successuflly.
 3- Alter.py: takes transmitted message and the position of bit to alter, outputs a message with error.
 4- CRC testing script: Run different queries the selected test case.
